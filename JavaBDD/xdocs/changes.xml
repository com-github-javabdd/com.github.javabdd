        Many new performance improvements for the native BuDDy library.
        Even if you are not using JavaBDD but are just using the BuDDy library
        with C or C++, you can use the included libbuddy.so to take advantage of
        these performance improvements.

    <release version="0.6" date="2003-10-31">
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="fix">
        Fixed security problems by adding better null and type checking.
        It should no longer be possible to crash the VM by passing in unexpected values.
      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="update">
        Updated API: applyWith(), etc. methods return the 'this' pointer, for easier nested operations.
      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="add">
        Addition of typed BDD factory, for type checking of BDD code.
      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="update">
        Code cleanups. JNI interface was made a few percent faster by moving object allocations into Java code.

    <release version="0.5" date="2003-8-4">
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="add">
        Major update.
        Added a 100% Java implementation of the BDD factory, so the native library is no longer necessary.
      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="add">
        Java implementation of variable domains. Domains can be up to 2^64 in size!
      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="add">
        Java implementation of bit vectors, along with the associated operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc.)
      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="fix">
        Fixes and extensions to the CUDD interface. Now CUDD can run all of the test cases correctly.

      <action dev="joewhaley" type="update">
        More small refinements to the API.
      </action>

      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="update">
        Improved the support for printing of BDDs.
        Now you can specify an interface that will convert the domain indices/members into meaningful strings.
      </action>
      <action dev="joewhaley" type="update">
        Some small updates to the API.
        Notably, scanSet() now takes a BDDDomain object, rather than a domain number.
